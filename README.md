# Traffic Sign Detection with Transfer Learning Models and CNN

## Overview

This project implements Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning models, including Xception, ResNet50, EfficientNet, etc., for accurate detection of traffic signs. Trained on a diverse Kaggle dataset, the models showcase robust recognition capabilities, contributing to improved road safety.

## Features

- Utilizes advanced CNN and transfer learning models
- Trained on a diverse Kaggle dataset
- Accurate recognition of various traffic sign categories

## Repository Contents

- **src:** https://github.com/arshupadhyay/Traffic-Sign-Detection-using-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning-Models/blob/main/DenseNet121.ipynb
- **dataset:** Kaggle dataset used contains 7,400 images of different traffic signs for trainig and validation.
